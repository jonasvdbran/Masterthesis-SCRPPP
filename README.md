# Masterthesis-SCRPPP
This contains all coding for the thesis Optimising Housekeeping In the Stochastic Container Relocation Problem, a two-stage approach. To follow the structure of the thesis, start with the container_classes notebook. The housekeeping algorithms from chapter 4 are presented in the files local search housekeeping and look-ahead housekeeping. To run these notebooks, you have to upload the .py version of container classes into the first cell in the notebook (after running this cel you can click on import file). The MILP and stochastic program are presented in the file MILP_StochasticProgramming. The results in the thesis were obtained using the local search housekeeping and Stochastic Programming file (together with the necessary container classes notebook to generate containers).
